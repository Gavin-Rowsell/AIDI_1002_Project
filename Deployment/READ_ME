Greenhouse temperature prediction model deployments

First model used to predict temperature of a greenhouse without any control systems based on current outside conditions. 
Second model used to predict temperature of greenhouse in 1 hour if no controls are used.

Weather conditions to be used can be collected from: https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/hourly-weather-forecast/ontario/windsor
or model can be given potential values.

Switch to the deployment branch of repository to view files used for deployment of ML model.
