Greenhouse temperature prediction model deployments

First model used to predict temperature of a greenhouse without any control systems based on current outside conditions. 
Second model used to predict temperature of greenhouse in 1 hour if no controls are used.

Weather conditions to be used can be collected from: https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/hourly-weather-forecast/ontario/windsor
or model can be given potential values.

The second model has a more specific use case:

When someone with a greenhouse wants to determine what their internal future temperature will be without using any control systems they can 
use hourly forcast data (such as the data from the above weather network link) along with their current greenhouse temperature to predict 
the change in the next hour. 

Once they have this prediction they can continue to step forward by the hour to see how their greenhouses internal temperature will elvolve 
over the couse of the day if they are not using any of their control systems. Due to certain conditions such as strong winds, pesticide use 
in the area, acid rain, etc standard cooling methods (opening vents) might not be viable. In some cases, internal temperature can be proactivly 
reduced before these conditions become a problem preventing damage crops may recieve from being outside their optimal temperature range. In 
order to make these proactive decisions, the predictive model can be used to determine when the internal temperature is likely to excced a 
target value.
